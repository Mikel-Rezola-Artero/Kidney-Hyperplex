This folder contains subfolders for each figure presented in the paper

Each subfolder is named according to its corresponding figure (e.g., "Figure 2E", "Figure S2A", etc.), and contains the R code used to generate that figure.

All figures are generated independently from the processed data, there is no shared code dependency between them unless otherwise stated.
