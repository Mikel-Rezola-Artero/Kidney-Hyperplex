This folder contains scripts for processing individual annotation regions or tissue types.

Each script contains the R code for a specific annotation or tissue used to clean and process the data for later analysis.
These scripts are designed to be run independently for each annotation or tissue type.
The code to generate the Figures S3C-D is included in the processing script for Tonsil data.
